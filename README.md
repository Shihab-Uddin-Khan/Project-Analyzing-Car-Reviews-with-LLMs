# Analyzing Car Reviews with Large Language Models

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed an **end-to-end NLP pipeline** that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze customer car reviews and enhance customer interaction for an auto dealership scenario. The solution is designed to **classify customer feedback**, **generate meaningful responses**, and **support multilingual communication**.

## Key Highlights

### Sentiment Analysis & Categorization
- Built a system to automatically detect whether a review was **positive, negative, or neutral**.
- Classified feedback into themes such as **design, performance, value for money, and customer service**.

### Intelligent Response Generation
- Implemented an **LLM-based module** that produces **human-like responses** to customer questions about car models and dealership services.

### Multilingual Translation
- Enabled **seamless translation** of dealership-related text into multiple languages to support international customers.

##  Skills Gained
- **Applied NLP with LLMs**: Hands-on experience in text classification, summarization, translation, and generative text tasks.
- **Practical AI Deployment**: Integrated multiple LLM functionalities into a **single workflow** tailored to business needs.
- **Data Handling & Evaluation**: Processed raw text data, extracted insights, and evaluated model performance using **accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score**.
- **Problem-Solving with AI**: Translated abstract dealership challenges into **concrete, AI-driven solutions**.

## Impact
This project demonstrates how LLMs can **transform customer engagement** in the automotive industry:
- Speeds up **review analysis**, allowing dealerships to identify strengths and weaknesses quickly.
- Improves **customer satisfaction** by generating quick, relevant, and natural responses.
- Expands **global reach** by enabling communication in multiple languages.

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Hugging Face Transformers, Evaluate, Pandas, Numpy
- **Core Models:** Pre-trained transformer-based LLMs

##  Outcomes
- Delivered a **functional prototype** showcasing LLM-driven automation for customer engagement.
- Gained confidence in using **transformer pipelines** for real-world NLP applications.
- Strengthened skills in **text classification, translation, and generative AI workflows**.
